/**
 * Application-scoped manager for in-flight downloads and installs.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Before this interface, every download/install ran inside the calling
 * ViewModel's `viewModelScope`. Two problems followed:
 *
 *   1. **Screen-leave kills installs** — navigating away from the
 *      details screen mid-download cancels the OkHttp call and deletes
 *      the partial file. Users had to camp on the screen to update
 *      anything.
 *
 *   2. **No cross-screen coordination** — the apps list and the details
 *      screen each had their own download bookkeeping. Hopping between
 *      screens lost progress, status, and cancel handles.
 *
 * The orchestrator solves both by owning a long-lived [CoroutineScope]
 * tied to the application's lifetime. ViewModels become **observers**
 * of [downloads] rather than **owners** of any work — when a screen is
 * destroyed, the work keeps running and the next screen instance picks
 * the state right back up.
 *
 * # Install policies
 *
 * Each enqueued download declares an [InstallPolicy] that controls what
 * happens when the bytes are on disk:
 *
 *   - [InstallPolicy.AlwaysInstall] — fire the installer no matter what.
 *     Used for **Shizuku** silent installs, where there's no UI dialog
 *     and the user has explicitly opted into the unattended path.
 *
 *   - [InstallPolicy.InstallWhileForeground] — fire the installer **only
 *     if the screen that requested the download is still alive**. The
 *     ViewModel must call [downgradeToDeferred] in `onCleared()`. If the
 *     downgrade lands before the download completes, the installer is
 *     not invoked; instead the file is parked, the row is marked
 *     "pending install", and the notifier is poked.
 *
 *   - [InstallPolicy.DeferUntilUserAction] — never auto-install. Used by
 *     the apps list when the user has tapped "Update" but the screen
 *     might leave at any moment, and by recovery flows. The file lands
 *     on disk and the user installs it explicitly.
 *
 * # Concurrency model
 *
 * Up to [maxConcurrent] downloads run in parallel; further `enqueue`
 * calls join an internal queue. Cancellation is per-package: cancelling
 * one download doesn't touch the others. Implementations should
 * surface a `SupervisorJob` so a single failed download can't poison
 * the scope.
 *
 * # Filename namespacing
 *
 * The orchestrator scopes filenames as `owner_repo_originalName.ext`
 * before passing them to the [zed.rainxch.core.domain.network.Downloader]
 * — this prevents collisions between two repos that ship installers
 * with the same name (e.g. `app.apk`).

     * without worrying about torn reads.
     *
     * Entries are removed when:
     *  - The install completes (foreground or Shizuku) and
     *    [dismiss] is called by the consuming ViewModel
     *  - The user explicitly dismisses a failed/cancelled download
     *  - The orchestrator is cleared (process death)
     *
     * Pending-install entries (`stage = AwaitingInstall`) survive
     * across screen instances precisely so the apps list can show
     * "ready to install" rows.
