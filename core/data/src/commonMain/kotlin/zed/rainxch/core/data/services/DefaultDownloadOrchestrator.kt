/**
 * Default implementation of [DownloadOrchestrator].
 *
 * # Lifetime
 *
 * Owned by Koin as a singleton with the application-scoped
 * [CoroutineScope] (see `coreModule`'s `CoroutineScope` factory). All
 * downloads run in [appScope] so they outlive any ViewModel that
 * triggered them. The orchestrator itself never cancels its scope —
 * the process going away does that for free.
 *
 * # Concurrency
 *
 * Uses a per-package [Mutex] surfaced via [stateMutex] to serialize
 * map mutations. Actual download/install work runs in [appScope] so
 * the mutex is only held for short metadata writes — never across
 * the long-running download.
 *
 * Up to [DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT] downloads run at once. Further
 * enqueue calls don't block — they just spawn a coroutine that
 * `delay`s while the active count is at capacity. The simpler "always
 * spawn, let the platform Downloader queue internally" approach is
 * tempting, but OkHttp doesn't queue — it'd open every connection at
 * once and likely hit GitHub's rate limit.
 *
 * # Filename namespacing
 *
 * Every download is written to disk with the
 * `<owner>_<repo>_<original>.ext` form via [AssetFileName.scoped].
 * This is the only place that name transformation lives — callers
 * pass the original asset name and the orchestrator handles the rest.
 * The scoped name is also what gets passed to [Downloader.download],
 * so the Downloader's per-name dedup map is automatically scoped.
 *
 * # Install policies
 *
 * See [InstallPolicy] for the rules. Implementation detail: the
 * "screen still attached" check at install time is done by re-reading
 * `installPolicy` from the live state map *after* the download
 * completes — never from a captured local — so a [downgradeToDeferred]
 * call lands atomically against the in-flight download.
